          <p className="text-center text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-teal-600 font-cta">Your Local Junk Removal Crew That Pays You Back</p>
          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">How It Works When We Show Up at Your Door — starting at $100/hr, We Handle Everything</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">When you call us, you&apos;re not talking to a call center. You&apos;re booking a local crew that knows your area, your dump sites, and your neighborhood. Here&apos;s what happens from the moment we pull up — whether it&apos;s <Link href="/services/furniture-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">a couch in your living room</Link>, <Link href="/services/estate-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">a full estate your family needs cleared</Link>, or <Link href="/services/office-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">an office your business is moving out of</Link>.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>Here&apos;s what nobody in the junk removal industry wants to talk about: <strong>every company out there has been charging you for the service AND keeping 35%+ of your items to resell for their own profit.</strong> Your working fridge, your solid wood table, your power tools — they charge you to take them, then flip them for hundreds of dollars. You got nothing. We built this company to end that. Our crew pulls up, introduces themselves, and walks through your space with you. You point at what goes and what stays. We do everything else — loading, carrying, stairs, hauling, dump. Starting at $100/hr, 1 hour minimum, dump fees included (an industry first). Whether you need a <Link href="/services/full-service-junk-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">full house cleared</Link>, a <Link href="/services/hot-tub-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">hot tub torn apart</Link>, or a <Link href="/services/construction-debris-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">jobsite cleaned up</Link> — same rate, and you get paid for what&apos;s worth something.</p>
            <p>Here&apos;s the part no other local junk company does: as we load, we look at every single item. That dresser your kids grew up with? If it&apos;s solid wood and in decent shape, it has resale value — and we credit you 50% (when applicable) of what it&apos;s worth. The fridge you&apos;re replacing? If it still works, that&apos;s $150-$300 in credit right off your bill. Your dad&apos;s old power tools? DeWalt and Milwaukee hold their value for years. We appraise everything right there in your driveway, you see every number, you approve every credit. If your credits add up to more than our hours, we hand you a check. That happens more than you&apos;d think — especially on <Link href="/services/estate-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">estate cleanouts</Link> and <Link href="/services/office-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">office jobs</Link>.</p>
            <p>We&apos;re local. Our crews live in the communities they serve. They know which items sell well in your area, where the recycling centers are, which charities accept donations nearby. That local knowledge means better appraisals, faster jobs, and more money back in your pocket. We&apos;re in <Link href="/locations" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">{CITY_COUNT}+ cities</Link> — but every job is personal. You&apos;re not a ticket number. You&apos;re the homeowner on Elm Street whose garage hasn&apos;t fit a car in three years, or the property manager who needs Unit 4B cleared by Friday, or the family dealing with Mom&apos;s house after she moved to assisted living. We get it, and we show up accordingly.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">Residential Junk Removal — We Come to Your Home and Handle Everything</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">These are the jobs our crews do every single day in neighborhoods just like yours. Garages that haven&apos;t fit a car in years. Basements full of boxes from three moves ago. Attics nobody&apos;s opened since 2015. We walk in, we clear it out, we credit you for the good stuff. Most jobs take 1-3 hours.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>You&apos;d be amazed what&apos;s hiding in the average home. That workbench your husband swore he&apos;d use? It&apos;s solid maple and worth $200 on the resale market. The treadmill that became a clothes rack? NordicTrack holds its value — that&apos;s $150 credit. The old fridge in the <Link href="/services/garage-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">garage</Link> you keep &quot;just in case&quot;? If it runs, it&apos;s worth $200-$400. Other junk companies haul all of this and sell it themselves. We walk through your space with you, point out what has value, and credit you half. Most homeowners save 25-40% compared to calling the other guys.</p>
            <p><Link href="/services/estate-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Estate cleanouts</Link> are where families see the biggest impact. When you&apos;re clearing a parent&apos;s home — decades of furniture, a full kitchen of appliances, tools in every drawer, closets full of things you didn&apos;t know existed — the last thing you need is a $3,000 bill from a junk company that&apos;s going to flip all of it. We&apos;ve had families walk away from estate cleanouts with a check for $500+ because Grandma&apos;s dining set and Grandpa&apos;s tool collection were worth more than the removal cost. That&apos;s the way it should work when you&apos;re already going through a hard time. <Link href="/services/hoarder-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Hoarder cleanouts</Link> and <Link href="/services/storage-unit-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">storage unit clearing</Link> follow the same model — we handle it with care and credit you for everything worth something.</p>

          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">Got one thing that needs to go? A couch that won&apos;t fit through the door, a fridge you just replaced, a treadmill you haven&apos;t touched in two years? We come to your house, pick it up, and if it&apos;s worth something, you get credit. Most pickups are done in under an hour — you pay the $100 minimum and often get money back.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>This is where calling us instead of &quot;the other guys&quot; makes the biggest difference per item. When you call a flat-rate company to haul a single refrigerator, they charge $150-$250 — doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s a dead unit from 2005 or a 3-year-old Samsung French door that works perfectly. With us, you pay $100 for the hour. That Samsung? It&apos;s worth $500 on the secondary market. We credit you $250. You just got paid $150 to have your fridge removed. Call <Link href="/pricing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">any other company in your area</Link> and ask if they&apos;ll do that.</p>
            <p><Link href="/services/furniture-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Furniture</Link> is the #1 call we get. That Pottery Barn sectional you bought for $4,000? Still worth $800-$1,200 in good condition. You get $400-$600 credited. The solid oak dining table from your parents? $200-$400 resale, $100-$200 back to you. Even that IKEA dresser has a buyer if it&apos;s not falling apart. <Link href="/services/appliance-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Appliances</Link> are right behind — every working washer, dryer, dishwasher, and oven has a landlord or flipper who wants it. <Link href="/services/exercise-equipment-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Gym equipment</Link> is the sleeper — that Peloton collecting dust is still worth $500+, and your weight set is basically cash by the pound.</p>
            <p>Then there are the big, ugly jobs nobody else wants to touch. A <Link href="/services/piano-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">piano</Link> that weighs 800 lbs and needs to go down a flight of stairs. A <Link href="/services/hot-tub-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">hot tub</Link> that needs to be cut apart and hauled off in pieces. A <Link href="/services/pool-table-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">pool table</Link> with a slate top that&apos;ll crush your toes if you look at it wrong.

            <p>Dumpster rental is a racket — $300-$800 per week, weight limits that renovation debris blows through in a day, and you still have to load the thing yourself. With <Link href="/services/construction-debris-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">construction debris removal</Link>, our crew does the loading. Concrete, drywall, lumber, tile, roofing — unlimited weight, starting at $100/hr, dump fees included. If you&apos;re mid-renovation and need pickups every few days, we set up a recurring schedule. Your jobsite stays clean, your driveway stays open, and you don&apos;t spend your Saturday hauling demo waste to the transfer station.</p>
            <p>If you&apos;re ripping out anything metal, pay attention: <Link href="/services/scrap-metal-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">scrap metal</Link> is where contractors get real money back. Copper pipe runs $3-$5 a pound. That replumb you just did? Could be $100-$200 in scrap credit sitting in a pile in the garage.

          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">If you run a business, manage property, or oversee a commercial space — this is where our model hits hardest. <Link href="/commercial" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Commercial furniture and equipment</Link> have the strongest resale markets of anything we touch. Our crew comes in after hours, clears your space, and the credits from your Herman Millers and standing desks often cover the whole bill.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>Let&apos;s talk real numbers. Your <Link href="/services/office-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">office has 50 Herman Miller chairs</Link>. Each one resells for $150-$500. That&apos;s $7,500-$25,000 in total resale value — and you get half. Meanwhile, the removal itself might take 8 hours starting at $100/hr = $800. Do the math. We&apos;ve literally handed business owners checks for $3,000-$8,000 after clearing their office. The other guys? They charge you $5,000 for the same job and sell your chairs on their own dime. You&apos;d never know.</p>

          <p className="text-center text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-teal-600 font-cta">Transparent Junk Removal Pricing For Every Service Type</p>
          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">How Junk Removal Pricing Works — starting at $100/hr Flat Rate With 50% Resale Credit (when applicable) on All {SERVICES.length} Services</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">No matter which of our {SERVICES.length} services you book, the pricing is identical. Here&apos;s exactly how it works so there are zero surprises. See our full <Link href="/pricing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">pricing page</Link> for examples and math breakdowns.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p><strong>The rate:</strong> $100 per hour, 1 hour minimum. This covers everything — labor, truck, fuel, dump fees, transfer station costs, and disposal. There are no add-on charges for heavy items, stairs, long carries, distance to the dump, demolition work, or anything else. If our crew works 2.5 hours, you pay $250 before credits. If they finish in 45 minutes, you pay the $100 minimum.</p>
            <p><strong>The credit:</strong> As items are loaded, our crew appraises anything with fair market resale value. You see every appraisal, you approve every credit. 50% of each item&apos;s appraised value is credited to your bill immediately. A $400 dining table earns you $200 credit. A $300 working refrigerator earns you $150. A $200 set of power tools earns you $100. Credits stack — the more valuable items in your job, the less you pay.</p>
            <p><strong>The payout:</strong> If your total credits exceed your total hours, we pay you the difference. This is most common on <Link href="/services/estate-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">estate cleanouts</Link>, <Link href="/services/office-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">office cleanouts</Link>, and <Link href="/services/garage-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">garage cleanouts</Link> with high concentrations of valuable items. We process payouts by check or digital transfer on the spot.</p>
            <p><strong>No contracts:</strong> Every job is standalone. No subscriptions, no recurring charges, no minimums beyond the 1 hour minimum. <Link href="/book-junk-removal-service-today" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Book when you need us</Link>, pay for the time we work, get credited for valuable items.

          <p className="text-center text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-widest text-teal-600 font-cta">Why Every Other Junk Removal Company Costs You More</p>
          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">We Pay You Junk Removal vs. 1-800-GOT-JUNK, Junk King & Traditional Haulers</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">Every other junk removal company in America uses the same broken model: charge you by truck volume, haul everything away, resell your valuable items for their own profit. Here&apos;s why that costs you more on every single one of these {SERVICES.length} services.</p>
          <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>Traditional junk removal companies charge $200-$800+ based on how much space your items take up in the truck. This volume-based pricing is inherently opaque — you can&apos;t verify how much space your items actually occupy, and the company has every incentive to round up. They also profit twice: once from your removal fee and again from reselling your valuable items. A couch worth $300 on the resale market costs you $150 to remove and makes them $300 in revenue. Your total loss: $450. Their total gain: $450.</p>
            <p>With We Pay You Junk Removal, that same couch costs you starting at $100/hr for removal time, and you get $150 credited to your bill (50% (when applicable) of $300 resale value). If the job takes one hour, you net $50 in credit toward other items on the truck. Even in the worst case — no valuable items at all — our starting at $100/hr rate is almost always cheaper than flat-rate pricing for the same volume of stuff, because you&apos;re paying for actual time, not an inflated volume estimate.</p>
            <p>This applies across all {SERVICES.length} of our services. <Link href="/services/furniture-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Furniture removal</Link> with us saves 30-50% vs flat-rate. <Link href="/services/appliance-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Appliance removal</Link> frequently results in payouts. <Link href="/services/office-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">Office cleanouts</Link> save businesses thousands. There is no scenario where the traditional model is cheaper than ours — the math always favors the customer.</p>
