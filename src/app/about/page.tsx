          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">Our Story — The Industry&apos;s Dirty Secret</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">
            We spent years inside the junk removal industry before launching We Pay You Junk Removal. What we saw convinced us the entire model was broken. Learn more about our <Link href="/pricing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">transparent pricing</Link>, our <Link href="/services" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">{SERVICES.length} services</Link>, and how we operate across <Link href="/locations" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">{CITY_COUNT} cities</Link>.
          </p>
          <div className="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-5 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p>Here&apos;s what the junk removal industry doesn&apos;t want you to know: every major company — from the franchises to the local operators — charges you full price to haul your stuff away, then turns around and resells 35% or more of it for pure profit. That vintage dresser, the working appliances, the power tools in the garage — they make money on your items and never share a dime with you. It&apos;s been this way for decades and nobody has challenged it.</p>
            <p>We spent years working in this industry, watching the same thing happen on every job. Crews would load a truck, take it back to the warehouse, sort through everything, and pull out items worth hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars. The customer never knew. They&apos;d already paid full price and walked away thinking everything went to the landfill. The resale revenue was pure margin for the company.</p>
            <p>We started asking a simple question: what if we split that value with the customer? The industry said it couldn&apos;t work. Too complicated. Too slow. Customers wouldn&apos;t care. We tested it anyway — first in one city, then five, then twenty. Customers didn&apos;t just care. They were stunned. They had no idea their &quot;junk&quot; had value, and they were thrilled to get credit for it.</p>
            <p>That radical idea became We Pay You Junk Removal. Today we operate in {CITY_COUNT} cities across all {STATE_COUNT} states with 50 offices and growing. We&apos;ve proven what the industry said was impossible: you can run a profitable junk removal company, charge a fair hourly rate with <Link href="/pricing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">dump fees included</Link>, and still share resale value with your customers. We do it every single day.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-3 text-center text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 font-heading">Our Mission &amp; Values</h2>
          <p className="mx-auto mt-4 max-w-2xl text-center text-base text-slate-600">
            Everything we do is guided by five core principles. From <Link href="/services/estate-cleanouts" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">estate cleanouts</Link> to <Link href="/services/furniture-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">furniture removal</Link>, these values show up in every <Link href="/book-junk-removal-service-today" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">job we book</Link>.
          </p>
          <div className="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-3xl space-y-5 text-center text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
            <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To build the most honest junk removal company in America — one that charges a fair rate, includes dump fees, and shares resale value with the people whose items we haul. We believe your stuff has value and you deserve a cut.</p>
            <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> No hidden fees. No surprise surcharges. No volume-based guessing games. Starting at $100/hr with a 1 hour minimum and dump fees included. You watch the clock. You see every appraisal. You approve every credit. Our <Link href="/pricing" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">pricing page</Link> tells you exactly what you&apos;ll pay — and we stick to it.</p>
            <p><strong>Fairness:</strong> The 50% Resale Credit (when applicable) exists because we refuse to profit from your items without sharing the upside. Other companies keep 100% of resale revenue. We split it 50/50 because that&apos;s what&apos;s right. If your credits exceed your bill, we pay you the difference — same day, on the spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong> We divert 60% of what we haul from landfills. Items with value get resold. Items without resale value but in usable condition get donated. Materials like metal, cardboard, and electronics get recycled. Only truly unsalvageable waste goes to the dump — and even then, we pay the dump fees so you don&apos;t have to.</p>
            <p><strong>Respect:</strong> Your home is your space. Our crews show up on time, protect your floors and walls, communicate clearly, and leave the space cleaner than they found it. We treat every job — from a single <Link href="/services/furniture-removal" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">couch removal</Link> to a full <Link href="/commercial" className="text-teal-700 font-semibold hover:underline">commercial cleanout</Link> — with the same level of care.</p>
